project contains Angular based Modules, Components, Injectables to build a sensor observation service based client. \n\n\nGetting Started\nDependencies\nNode/NPM\nInstall latest Node and NPM following the instructions. Make sure you have Node version ≥ 7.0 and NPM ≥ 4.\n\nbrew install node for Mac.\n\nYarn\nYarn package manager is optional but highly recommended. If you prefer to work with npm directly you may ignore this step.\nYarn installs library dependencies faster and also locks theirs versions. It has more advantages but these two are already pretty attractive. \nInstall Yarn by following the instructions.\n\nbrew install yarn for Mac.\n\nInstalling\n\nfork this repository.\nclone your fork to your local environment.\nyarn install to install required dependencies (or npm i).\n\nBuild the library\n\nyarn build for building the library once (both ESM and AOT versions).\nyarn build:watch for building the library (both ESM and AOT versions) and watch for file changes.\n\nYou may also build UMD bundle and ESM files separately:\n\nyarn build:esm - for building AOT/JIT compatible versions of files.\nyarn build:esm:watch - the same as previous command but in watch-mode.\nyarn build:umd - for building UMD bundle only.\nyarn build:umd:watch - the same as previous command but in watch-mode.\n\nOther commands\nLint the code\n\nyarn lint for performing static code analysis.\n\nTest the library\n\nyarn test for running all your *.spec.ts tests once. Generated code coverage report may be found in coverage folder.\nyarn test:watch for running all you *.spec.ts and watch for file changes.\n\nGenerate documentation\n\nyarn docs for generating documentation locally.\nyarn gh-pages for generating documentation and uploading it to GitHub Pages. Documentation example.\n\nExplore the bundle\n\nyarn explorer to find out where all your code in bundle is coming from.\n\nBump library version\n\nnpm version patch to increase library version. More on bumping.\n\npreversion script in this case will automatically run project testing and linting in prior in order to check that the library is ready for publishing.\nPublish library to NPM\n\nnpm publish to publish your library sources on npmjs.com. Once the library is published it will be available for usage in npm packages.\n\nprepublishOnly script in this case will automatically run project testing and linting in prior in order to check that the library is ready for publishing.\nCleaning\n\nyarn clean:tmp command will clean up all temporary files like docs, dist, coverage etc.\nyarn clean:all command will clean up all temporary files along with node_modules folder. \n\nLibrary development workflow\nIn order to debug your library in browser you need to have Angular project that will consume your library, build the application and display it. For your convenience all of that should happen automatically in background so once you change library source code you should instantly see the changes in browser.\nThere are several ways to go here:\n\nUse your real library-consumer project and link your library to it via yarn link command (see below).\nUse demo applications that are provided for your convenience as a part of this repository.\nUse Angular-CLI to generate library-consumer project for you and then use yarn link to link your library to it.\n\n\nUsing yarn link\nIn you library root folder:\n# Create symbolic link\nyarn link\n\n# Build library in watch mode\nyarn build:watchIn you project folder that should consume the library:\n# Link you library to the project\nyarn link \"angular-library-seed\"\n\n# Build your project. In case of Angular-CLI use the following command.\nng serve --aotThen you need to import your library into your project's source code.\nNow, once you update your library source code it will automatically be re-compiled and your project will be re-built so you may see library changes instantly.\nMore information about yarn link command.\n\nAt the moment of publishing this project there is a bug exists when using yarn link in combination with Angular CLI. The issue is caused by having node_modules folder inside linked library. There is a workaround has been provided that suggests to add a paths property with all Angular dependencies to the tsconfig.json file of the Angular CLI project like it is shown below:\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"paths\": { \"@angular/*\": [\"../node_modules/@angular/*\"] }\n  }\n}\nTroubleshooting while using this library\n\nadd allowSyntheticDefaultImports: true to your tsconfig.json to avoid error messages like ... has no default export\ndon't forget to add styles of nested dependencies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nApache License\nVersion 2.0, January 2004http://www.apache.org/licenses/>\nTerms and Conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution\n1.
