Description\n    \n    \n        Implements the abstract ListEntryComponent, which has the following functions:\n\ncan be selected and is selectable internally, with a corresponding output event\ncan be deleted, which also triggers an output event\ntranslatable, so it triggers the methode onLanguageChanged when the language is switched\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        Extends\n    \n    \n

instructions. Make sure you have Node version ≥ 7.0 and NPM ≥ 4.\n\nbrew install node for Mac.\n\nInstalling\n\nfork this repository.\nclone your fork to your local environment.\nnpm install to install required dependencies.\n\nBuild the libraries\n\nnpm run build:libs for building the library once\n\nOther commands\nLint the complete code\n\nng lint for performing static code analysis.\n\nGenerate documentation\n\nnpm run compodoc for generating documentation locally\nnpm run gh-pages for generating documentation and uploading it to GitHub Pages\n\nBump library version\n\nnpm version *** to increase library version. More on bumping.\n\n\nPublish library to NPM\n\nyarn lib:publish to publish your library sources on npmjs.com. Once the library is published it will be available for usage in npm packages.\n\n\nUsing demo applications\n\njust start the demo with ng serve and the demo is published \n\n At the moment of publishing this project there is a [bug](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/3854) exists when using `yarn link` in combination with Angular CLI. The issue is caused by having `node_modules` folder inside linked library. There is a [workaround](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/3854#issuecomment-274344771) has been provided that suggests to add a `paths` property with all Angular dependencies to the `tsconfig.json` file of the Angular CLI project like it is shown below:\n\n```\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"paths\": { \"@angular/*\": [\"../node_modules/@angular/*\"] }\n  }\n}\n``` -->\nSupported series API versions mapping\n\n\n\nhelgoland-toolbox version\nseries rest API version\n\n\n\n\nv0.0.1-alpha.53\nv1.10.2\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting while using this library\n\nadd allowSyntheticDefaultImports: true to your tsconfig.json to avoid error messages like ... has no default export\ndon't forget to add styles of nested dependencies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nApache License\nVersion 2.0, January 2004http://www.apache.org/licenses/>\nTerms and Conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution\n1.

observation service based client. It is divided in different Modules to support specific needs. Currently the toolbox comprise the following modules:\n\nauth - Currently with a basic-auth handling\ncaching - http request caching for completed and running requests\ncontrol - some ui controls (e.g. toggle button)\ncore - Dataset-Api communication and response model, important services (local storage), important interfaces\nd3 - timeseries and trajectory graph presentation with D3.js\ndepiction - components to show data or metadata (e.g. dataset data table, timeseries entry, label-mapper)\neventing - describes the model of the eventing API and has an interface to communicate with the API\nfavorite - components and services to handle datasets in favorites\nflot - timeseries graph presentation with Flot\nmap - components to display leaflet maps for view or selection, and also some map controls (geo-search, locate, zoom)\nmodification - dataset modification (color or other graph represent points)\npermalink - components to generate permalinks and service to resolve them\nplotly - profile graph presentation with plotly.js\nselector - components for dataset selection (list, filter, service)\ntime - components to manipulate/select timeperiods or timestamps\n\nDataset handling\nInternal dataset id generation\nFor a better handling of datasets of different APIs, there exists an internal strategy to create dataset ids out of the url of an API and the API specific dataset ID.\nThe generation and resolving of this internal ID is handled in the InternalIdHandler\n\nExample: For a dataset with the id 123 of the service api https://www.sample.de/api/v1/ the internal id looks like https://www.sample.de/api/v1/__123\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/how-tos.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/how-tos.html","title":"additional-page - How Tos","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Tos\nTo get in touch with the helgoland-toolbox, here you will find a list of how tos:\n\nIntegrate a D3 timeseries component\nIntegrate a table component\nExtend a timeseries entry component\nConfigure a map component\n\nPreparing a how to app with angular-cli\nStarting from the very beginning in setting up the ng-app, angular-cli needs to be installed with npm.

For translations ngx-translate is used and the ngx-translate-http-loader will load the translations.\n\n\n\nInstall dependencies\n\n\n\n\nnpm i @helgoland/core\n\n\nnpm i @helgoland/d3\n\n\nnpm i @ngx-translate/http-loader\n\n\n\nImport dependencies to your ng-app by adding the following javascript code to src/app/app.module.ts:\n// Add dependencies for helgoland components.\nimport { HelgolandD3Module } from '@helgoland/d3';\nimport { DatasetApiInterface, SplittedDataDatasetApiInterface } from '@helgoland/core';\n\n// Add dependencies for translations.\nimport { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport { TranslateLoader, TranslateModule } from '@ngx-translate/core';\nimport { TranslateHttpLoader } from '@ngx-translate/http-loader';Another step is to add the dependencies correctly to the @NgModule. As imports we will define the TranslateModule and the HelgolandD3Module and as providers we need to take the DatasetApiInterface with the SplittedDataDatasetApiInterface as useClass. To use the translation functions we will add a function called HttpLoaderFactory which is to be exported.\nYou can compare your src/app/app.module.ts file with the following code below:\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    TranslateModule.forRoot({\n      loader: {\n        provide: TranslateLoader,\n        useFactory: HttpLoaderFactory,\n        deps: [HttpClient]\n      }\n    }),\n    HelgolandD3Module\n  ],\n  providers: [\n    {\n      provide: DatasetApiInterface,\n      useClass: SplittedDataDatasetApiInterface\n    }\n  ],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n\nexport function HttpLoaderFactory(http: HttpClient) {\n  return new TranslateHttpLoader(http);\n}Suggestions for error handling\n\nCannot find namespace 'GeoJSON' see below\n\nBy manually adapting the configuration in src/tsconfig.app.js this issue should be solved. But to let the changes be accepted, the app has to be restarted (by executing ng serve). Add to the types-array the type geojson which then should look like this:\n{\n  \"extends\": \"../tsconfig.json\",\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"outDir\": \"../out-tsc/app\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \"./\",\n    \"module\": \"es2015\",\n    \"types\": [\"geojson\"]\n  },\n  \"exclude\": [\n    \"test.ts\",\n    \"**/*.spec.ts\"\n  ]\n}Step 2: add code\nNow we will integrate the directive of the D3 timeseries component. Implement the directive of the graph by adding the following code to src/app/app.component.html. All fields in the n52-d3-timeseries-graph-directive are required to provide options, datasets and other information.\nEvery other code that was generated by the app creation is not necessary to run the D3 timeseries component. This can be deleted or kept for further coding.\n\n  \n\nOptional the style can be adapted by adding a css style modification to the directive. For example the following code will change the size:  \n\nThis code is implemented in the helgoland-toolbox github repository and can be viewed here.\nImplement the functionality of the n52-d3-timeseries-graph-directive by adding the following code to the class AppComponent in src/app/app.component.ts:\n\nAttention: If you would like to have pre-selected colors for your graph, you can change and add the color as string in the array of the variable colors. If you do not provide any color-entries in the array or not enough color-entries with this array, all missing colors will be randomly generated in the D3 timeseries component, because each graph needs an own color-entry.\n\n// These variables define the links for accessing the datasets and in which colors they are styled.\npublic datasetIdsMultiple = ['http://www.fluggs.de/sos2/api/v1/__63', 'http://www.fluggs.de/sos2/api/v1/__72'];\npublic colors = ['#123456', '#FF0000'];\n\n// The timespan will be set to the last 28 hours which is calculated in milliseconds (milliseconds*1000 = 100000000).\npublic timespan = new Timespan(new Date().getTime() - 100000000, new Date().getTime());\n\n// These are the plotting options. The boolen of 'togglePanZoom' is set to 'true' to pan the graph.\npublic diagramOptionsD3: D3PlotOptions = {\n    togglePanZoom: true,\n    showReferenceValues: false,\n    generalizeAllways: true\n};\n\n// 'selectedIds' determines the graphs that are visualized with a larger stroke-width. This can be set by clicking on the y-axis.\npublic selectedIds: string[] = [];\npublic datasetOptionsMultiple: Map = new Map();\n\nconstructor() {\n    this.datasetIdsMultiple.forEach((entry, i) => {\n        this.datasetOptionsMultiple.set(entry, new DatasetOptions(entry, this.colors[i]));\n    });\n}\n\n// This function changes the timespan of the graph which is needed for panning (and zooming).\npublic timespanChanged(timespan: Timespan) {\n    this.timespan = timespan;\n}This code is implemented in the helgoland-toolbox github repository and can be viewed here.\nA very important step should not be missedTo use the functionality of the functions in the src/app/app.component.ts we need to add the dependencies to use for example Timespan and D3PlotOptions. This is done by using the following imports:\nimport { DatasetOptions, Timespan } from '@helgoland/core';\nimport { D3PlotOptions } from '@helgoland/d3';Step 3: start working\nNow, that we have added all dependencies and the code to access the functionality of the D3 timeseries component you can start working on your app. If you did not run the app while following this tutorial you should now see the timeseries graph by starting your app with ng serve.\nAdditional Options\nAdd initial min, max value for y axis\nIt is possible to emit a min and max value for the y-axis with the DatasetOptions for each dataset. With these values, the y-axis will only show the selected y-range. Some restrictions are:\n\nIf there is no data provided in the selected timerange and y-axis min/max values, the default min and max range will be used.\nIf the y-axis min and max values are equal, the default min and max range will be used.\n\nZero-based y axis\nIt is possible to set a boolean in the DatasetOptions (zeroBasedYAxis) to show the y axis with minimum as 0, if the data in the selected timerange is above 0, or maximum 0, if the data in the selected timerange is below 0.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/how-tos/integrate-a-table-component.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/how-tos/integrate-a-table-component.html","title":"additional-page - Integrate a table component","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to integrate a table component\nIn this tutorial a stepwise instruction will be given on how to integrate a table component into an angular app (ng-app).\nA quite similar code is integrated in the helgoland-toolbox github repository and can be viewed here.\nFirst initialize an app as described in the prepare section here or integrate this component in an existing project.\nStep 1: import helgoland dependencies\nTo start working with the table component a few dependencies are needed: helgoland-depiction and helgoland-core are necessary to provide the table component.
