project contains Angular based Modules, Components, Injectables to build a sensor observation service based client. \nGetting Started\nDependencies\nNode/NPM\nInstall latest Node and NPM following the instructions. Make sure you have Node version ≥ 7.0 and NPM ≥ 4.\n\nbrew install node for Mac.\n\nInstalling\n\nfork this repository.\nclone your fork to your local environment.\nnpm install to install required dependencies.\n\nBuild the libraries\n\nnpm run build:libs for building the library once\n\nOther commands\nLint the complete code\n\nng lint for performing static code analysis.\n\nGenerate documentation\n\nnpm run compodoc for generating documentation locally\nnpm run gh-pages for generating documentation and uploading it to GitHub Pages\n\nBump library version\n\nnpm version *** to increase library version. More on bumping.\n\n\n\nPublish library to NPM\n\nyarn lib:publish to publish your library sources on npmjs.com. Once the library is published it will be available for usage in npm packages.\n\n\n\nUsing demo applications\n\njust start the demo with ng serve and the demo is published \n\n At the moment of publishing this project there is a [bug](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/3854) exists when using `yarn link` in combination with Angular CLI. The issue is caused by having `node_modules` folder inside linked library. There is a [workaround](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/3854#issuecomment-274344771) has been provided that suggests to add a `paths` property with all Angular dependencies to the `tsconfig.json` file of the Angular CLI project like it is shown below:\n\n```\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"paths\": { \"@angular/*\": [\"../node_modules/@angular/*\"] }\n  }\n}\n``` -->\n\nSupported series API versions mapping\n\n\n\nhelgoland-toolbox version\nseries rest API version\n\n\n\n\nv0.0.1-alpha.53\nv1.10.2\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting while using this library\n\nadd allowSyntheticDefaultImports: true to your tsconfig.json to avoid error messages like ... has no default export\ndon't forget to add styles of nested dependencies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nApache License\nVersion 2.0, January 2004http://www.apache.org/licenses/>\nTerms and Conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution\n1.

observation service based client. It is divided in different Modules to support specific needs. Currently the toolbox comprise the following modules:\n\nauth - Currently with a basic-auth handling\ncaching - http request caching for completed and running requests\ncontrol - some ui controls (e.g. toggle button)\ncore - Dataset-Api communication and response model, important services (local storage), important interfaces\nd3 - timeseries and trajectory graph presentation with D3.js\ndepiction - components to show data or metadata (e.g. dataset data table, timeseries entry, label-mapper)\neventing - describes the model of the eventing API and has an interface to communicate with the API\nfavorite - components and services to handle datasets in favorites\nmap - components to display leaflet maps for view or selection, and also some map controls (geo-search, locate, zoom)\nmodification - dataset modification (color or other graph represent points)\npermalink - components to generate permalinks and service to resolve them\nplotly - profile graph presentation with plotly.js\nselector - components for dataset selection (list, filter, service)\ntime - components to manipulate/select timeperiods or timestamps\n\nDataset handling\nInternal dataset id generation\nFor a better handling of datasets of different APIs, there exists an internal strategy to create dataset ids out of the url of an API and the API specific dataset ID.\nThe generation and resolving of this internal ID is handled in the InternalIdHandler\n\nExample: For a dataset with the id 123 of the service api https://www.sample.de/api/v1/ the internal id looks like https://www.sample.de/api/v1/__123\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/how-tos.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/how-tos.html","title":"additional-page - How Tos","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Tos\nTo get in touch with the helgoland-toolbox, here you will find a list of how tos:\n\nIntegrate a D3 timeseries component\nIntegrate a table component\nIntegrate a map component\nExtend a timeseries entry component\nConfigure a map component\nUsing basic auth services\nHandle styling options for datasets\nAdd last value map selector\n\nPreparing a how to app with angular-cli\nStarting from the very beginning in setting up the ng-app, angular-cli needs to be installed with npm. If you already have a running project skip this step and start with one of the how-tos.\nFollowing the instructions of the angular quickstart guide a new ng-app will be created with its folder-structure.\nOpen a terminal and change the working directory to the supposed location, where you want to create your ng-app with an integrated D3 timeseries component. In this tutorial the new ng-app will be named helgoland-how-to.\n\n\n\nStep\nCommand\n\n\n\n\nInstall angular-cli\nnpm install -g @angular/cli\n\n\nCreate ng-app\nng new helgoland-how-to\n\n\nChange into app-folder\ncd helgoland-how-to\n\n\nStart app\nng serve\n\n\n\nSuggestions for error handling\n\nCannot find module '@angular-devkit/core' click here\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/how-tos/integrate-a-d3-timeseries-component.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/how-tos/integrate-a-d3-timeseries-component.html","title":"additional-page - Integrate a D3 timeseries component","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Integrate a D3 timeseries component\nIn this tutorial a stepwise instruction will be given on how to integrate a D3 timeseries component into an angular app (ng-app).\nFirst initialize an app as described in the prepare section here or integrate this component in an existing project.\nStep 1: import helgoland dependencies\nTo start working with the helgoland D3 component a few dependencies are needed: helgoland-d3 and helgoland-core are necessary to provide the D3 timeseries component, in detail, to visualize the diagram containing the dataset graphs and to get accesss via the dataset API. For translations ngx-translate is used and the ngx-translate-http-loader will load the translations.\n\n\n\nInstall dependencies\n\n\n\n\nnpm i @helgoland/core\n\n\nnpm i @helgoland/d3\n\n\nnpm i @ngx-translate/http-loader\n\n\n\nImport dependencies to your ng-app by adding the following javascript code to src/app/app.module.ts:\n// Add dependencies for helgoland components.\nimport { HelgolandD3Module } from '@helgoland/d3';\nimport { DatasetApiInterface, SplittedDataDatasetApiInterface } from '@helgoland/core';\n\n// Add dependencies for translations.\nimport { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport { TranslateLoader, TranslateModule } from '@ngx-translate/core';\nimport { TranslateHttpLoader } from '@ngx-translate/http-loader';Another step is to add the dependencies correctly to the @NgModule. As imports we will define the TranslateModule and the HelgolandD3Module and as providers we need to take the DatasetApiInterface with the SplittedDataDatasetApiInterface as useClass. To use the translation functions we will add a function called HttpLoaderFactory which is to be exported.\nYou can compare your src/app/app.module.ts file with the following code below:\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    TranslateModule.forRoot({\n      loader: {\n        provide: TranslateLoader,\n        useFactory: HttpLoaderFactory,\n        deps: [HttpClient]\n      }\n    }),\n    HelgolandD3Module\n  ],\n  providers: [\n    {\n      provide: DatasetApiInterface,\n      useClass: SplittedDataDatasetApiInterface\n    }\n  ],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n\nexport function HttpLoaderFactory(http: HttpClient) {\n  return new TranslateHttpLoader(http);\n}Suggestions for error handling\n\nCannot find namespace 'GeoJSON' see below\n\nBy manually adapting the configuration in src/tsconfig.app.js this issue should be solved. But to let the changes be accepted, the app has to be restarted (by executing ng serve). Add to the types-array the type geojson which then should look like this:\n{\n  \"extends\": \"../tsconfig.json\",\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"outDir\": \"../out-tsc/app\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \"./\",\n    \"module\": \"es2015\",\n    \"types\": [\"geojson\"]\n  },\n  \"exclude\": [\n    \"test.ts\",\n    \"**/*.spec.ts\"\n  ]\n}Step 2: add code\nNow we will integrate the directive of the D3 timeseries component. Implement the directive of the graph by adding the following code to src/app/app.component.html. All fields in the n52-d3-timeseries-graph-directive are required to provide options, datasets and other information.\nEvery other code that was generated by the app creation is not necessary to run the D3 timeseries component. This can be deleted or kept for further coding.\n\n  \n\nOptional the style can be adapted by adding a css style modification to the directive. For example the following code will change the size:  \n\nThis code is implemented in the helgoland-toolbox github repository and can be viewed here.\nImplement the functionality of the n52-d3-timeseries-graph-directive by adding the following code to the class AppComponent in src/app/app.component.ts:\n\nAttention: If you would like to have pre-selected colors for your graph, you can change and add the color as string in the array of the variable colors. If you do not provide any color-entries in the array or not enough color-entries with this array, all missing colors will be randomly generated in the D3 timeseries component, because each graph needs an own color-entry.\n\n// These variables define the links for accessing the datasets and in which colors they are styled.\npublic datasetIdsMultiple = ['http://www.fluggs.de/sos2/api/v1/__63', 'http://www.fluggs.de/sos2/api/v1/__72'];\npublic colors = ['#123456', '#FF0000'];\n\n// The timespan will be set to the last 28 hours which is calculated in milliseconds (milliseconds*1000 = 100000000).\npublic timespan = new Timespan(new Date().getTime() - 100000000, new Date().getTime());\n\n// These are the plotting options. The boolen of 'togglePanZoom' is set to 'true' to pan the graph.\npublic diagramOptionsD3: D3PlotOptions = {\n    togglePanZoom: true,\n    showReferenceValues: false,\n    generalizeAllways: true\n};\n\n// 'selectedIds' determines the graphs that are visualized with a larger stroke-width. This can be set by clicking on the y-axis.\npublic selectedIds: string[] = [];\npublic datasetOptionsMultiple: Map = new Map();\n\nconstructor() {\n    this.datasetIdsMultiple.forEach((entry, i) => {\n        this.datasetOptionsMultiple.set(entry, new DatasetOptions(entry, this.colors[i]));\n    });\n}\n\n// This function changes the timespan of the graph which is needed for panning (and zooming).\npublic timespanChanged(timespan: Timespan) {\n    this.timespan = timespan;\n}This code is implemented in the helgoland-toolbox github repository and can be viewed here.\nA very important step should not be missedTo use the functionality of the functions in the src/app/app.component.ts we need to add the dependencies to use for example Timespan and D3PlotOptions. This is done by using the following imports:\nimport { DatasetOptions, Timespan } from '@helgoland/core';\nimport { D3PlotOptions } from '@helgoland/d3';Step 3: start working\nNow, that we have added all dependencies and the code to access the functionality of the D3 timeseries component you can start working on your app. If you did not run the app while following this tutorial you should now see the timeseries graph by starting your app with ng serve.\nAdditional Options\nAdd initial min, max value for y axis\nIt is possible to emit a min and max value for the y-axis with the DatasetOptions for each dataset. With these values, the y-axis will only show the selected y-range. Some restrictions are:\n\nIf there is no data provided in the selected timerange and y-axis min/max values, the default min and max range will be used.\nIf the y-axis min and max values are equal, the default min and max range will be used.\n\nZero-based y axis\nIt is possible to set a boolean in the DatasetOptions (zeroBasedYAxis) to show the y axis with minimum as 0, if the data in the selected timerange is above 0, or maximum 0, if the data in the selected timerange is below 0.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/how-tos/integrate-a-table-component.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/how-tos/integrate-a-table-component.html","title":"additional-page - Integrate a table component","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to integrate a table component\nIn this tutorial a stepwise instruction will be given on how to integrate a table component into an angular app (ng-app).\nA quite similar code is integrated in the helgoland-toolbox github repository and can be viewed here.\nFirst initialize an app as described in the prepare section here or integrate this component in an existing project.\nStep 1: import helgoland dependencies\nTo start working with the table component a few dependencies are needed: helgoland-depiction and helgoland-core are necessary to provide the table component. For translations ngx-translate is used and the ngx-translate-http-loader will load the translations.\n\n\n\nInstall dependencies\n\n\n\n\nnpm i @helgoland/core\n\n\nnpm i @helgoland/depiction\n\n\nnpm i @ngx-translate/http-loader\n\n\n\nImport dependencies to your ng-app by adding the following javascript code to src/app/app.module.ts:\n// Add dependencies for helgoland components.\nimport { HelgolandDatasetTableModule } from '@helgoland/depiction/dataset-table';\nimport { DatasetApiInterface, SplittedDataDatasetApiInterface } from '@helgoland/core';\n\n// Add dependencies for translations.\nimport { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport { TranslateLoader, TranslateModule } from '@ngx-translate/core';\nimport { TranslateHttpLoader } from '@ngx-translate/http-loader';Another step is to add the dependencies correctly to the @NgModule. As imports we will define the TranslateModule and the HelgolandDatasetTableModule and as providers we need to take the DatasetApiInterface with the SplittedDataDatasetApiInterface as useClass. To use the translation functions we will add a function called HttpLoaderFactory which is to be exported.\nYou can compare your src/app/app.module.ts file with the following code below:\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    TranslateModule.forRoot({\n      loader: {\n        provide: TranslateLoader,\n        useFactory: HttpLoaderFactory,\n        deps: [HttpClient]\n      }\n    }),\n    HelgolandDatasetTableModule\n  ],\n  providers: [\n    {\n      provide: DatasetApiInterface,\n      useClass: SplittedDataDatasetApiInterface\n    }\n  ],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n\nexport function HttpLoaderFactory(http: HttpClient) {\n  return new TranslateHttpLoader(http);\n}Suggestions for error handling\n\nCannot find namespace 'GeoJSON' see below\n\nBy manually adapting the configuration in src/tsconfig.app.js this issue should be solved. But to let the changes be accepted, the app has to be restarted (by executing ng serve). Add to the types-array the type geojson which then should look like this:\n{\n  \"extends\": \"../tsconfig.json\",\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"outDir\": \"../out-tsc/app\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \"./\",\n    \"module\": \"es2015\",\n    \"types\": [\"geojson\"]\n  },\n  \"exclude\": [\n    \"test.ts\",\n    \"**/*.spec.ts\"\n  ]\n}Step 2: add code\nNow we will integrate the directive of the table component. Implement the directive of the table by replacing all of src/app/app.component.html with the following code. All fields in the n52-dataset-table-directive are required to provide options, datasets and other information.\nImplement the parameter for the n52-dataset-table-directive by adding the following code to the class AppComponent in src/app/app.component.ts:\n// defines the dataset by internal id structure\npublic datasetIds = [\n  'http://sensorweb.demo.52north.org/sensorwebtestbed/api/v1/__95',\n  'http://sensorweb.demo.52north.org/sensorwebtestbed/api/v1/__96',\n  'http://geo.irceline.be/sos/api/v1/__6941',\n  'http://sensorweb.demo.52north.org/sensorwebtestbed/api/v1/__97'\n];\n\n// defines the timeframe for which data should be fetched\npublic timespan = new Timespan(\n  new Date('2017-10-24T01:49:59.000Z').getTime(),\n  new Date('2017-10-25T01:49:59.000Z').getTime()\n);\n\n// defines the datasetOptions, where the color can be set\npublic datasetOptions: Map = new Map();\n\nconstructor() {\n  let i = 0;\n  // sets the color to the datasetOptions\n  const colors = ['firebrick', 'yellow', 'darkgreen', 'lightblue'];\n  this.datasetIds.forEach((entry) => {\n    this.datasetOptions.set(entry, new DatasetOptions(entry, colors[i++]));\n  });\n}This code is implemented in the helgoland-toolbox github repository and can be viewed here.\nA very important step should not be missedTo use the functionality of the functions in the src/app/app.component.ts we need to add the dependencies to use for example DatasetOptions and Timespan. This is done by using the following imports:\nimport { DatasetOptions, Timespan } from '@helgoland/core';Suggestions for error handling\n\nerror TS2307: Cannot find module '@helgoland/depiction/dataset-table'. Please upgrade the typescript dependency to a least 2.6.0 by npm i typescript@~2.6\n\nStep 3: start working\nNow, that we have added all dependencies and the code to access the functionality of the table component you can start working on your app. If you did not run the app while following this tutorial you should now see the dataset table by starting your app with ng serve.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/how-tos/integrate-a-map-component.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/how-tos/integrate-a-map-component.html","title":"additional-page - Integrate a map component","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Integrate a helgoland map\nIn this tutorial a stepwise instruction will be given on how to integrate a helgoland map into an angular app (ng-app).\nFirst initialize an app as described in the prepare section here or integrate the helgoland map in an existing project. In the following we will refer to the class AppComponent as main class, where we will add the helgoland map. In case of intergating the helgoland map into an existing project, it should be taken care of to add the code in the correct html, ts and module files.\nDuring the integration of the helgoland map, errors might occur. Please read the steps till the end to use the provided solutions for potential errors.\nStep 1: import helgoland dependencies\nTo start working with the helgoland map a few dependencies are needed:\n\nhelgoland-map and helgoland-core are necessary to provide the app with access to various helgoland map specifications.\nFor translations ngx-translate is used and the ngx-translate-http-loader will load the translations.\nhelgoland-selector and helgoland-depiction are used for further interaction with the map.\n\n\n\n\nInstall dependencies\n\n\n\n\nnpm i @helgoland/core\n\n\nnpm i @helgoland/map\n\n\nnpm i @ngx-translate/http-loader\n\n\n\n\n\nnpm i @helgoland/selector\n\n\nnpm i @helgoland/depiction\n\n\n\nImport dependencies to your ng-app by adding the following javascript code to src/app/app.module.ts:\n// Add dependencies for helgoland components.\nimport { HelgolandMapSelectorModule } from '@helgoland/map';\nimport { DatasetApiInterface, SplittedDataDatasetApiInterface } from '@helgoland/core';\n\n// Add dependencies for translations.\nimport { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport { TranslateLoader, TranslateModule } from '@ngx-translate/core';\nimport { TranslateHttpLoader } from '@ngx-translate/http-loader';Another step is to add the dependencies correctly to the @NgModule. As imports we will define the TranslateModule and as providers we need to take the DatasetApiInterface with the SplittedDataDatasetApiInterface as useClass. To use the translation functions we will add a function called HttpLoaderFactory which needs to be exported.\nFurther, to add a helgoland map, we need to add HelgolandMapSelectorModule to the imports.\nYou can compare your src/app/app.module.ts file with the following code below:\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    AppRoutingModule,\n    TranslateModule.forRoot({\n      loader: {\n        provide: TranslateLoader,\n        useFactory: HttpLoaderFactory,\n        deps: [HttpClient]\n      }\n    }),\n    HelgolandMapSelectorModule\n  ],\n  providers: [\n    {\n      provide: DatasetApiInterface,\n      useClass: SplittedDataDatasetApiInterface\n    }\n  ],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n\nexport function HttpLoaderFactory(http: HttpClient) {\n  return new TranslateHttpLoader(http);\n}To fully add leaflet to the app, we need to make sure, that the tiles of the leaflet map are loaded. Therefore we will need to embed the leaflet styles into the main styles.scss:\n@import '~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';Suggestions for error handling\nredeclare block-scoped variable 'ngDevMode'\nERROR in node_modules/@angular/core/src/render3/ng_dev_mode.d.ts(9,11): error TS2451: Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'ngDevMode'.Solution: add to your main tsconfig.json the following code after lib (click here for more information regarding this issue)\n,\n\"paths\": {\n    \"@angular/*\":[\"node_modules/@angular/*\"],\n}rxjs\nERROR in node_modules/@helgoland/map/lib/base/geosearch/geosearch.d.ts(3,10): error TS2305: Module '\"./helgoland-how-to/node_modules/rxjs/Observable\"' has no exported member 'Observable'.\nnode_modules/@helgoland/map/lib/base/geosearch/nominatim.service.d.ts(4,10): error TS2305: Module '\"./helgoland-how-to/node_modules/rxjs/Observable\"' has no exported member 'Observable'.\nnode_modules/rxjs/Observable.d.ts(1,15): error TS2307: Cannot find module 'rxjs-compat/Observable'.\nnode_modules/rxjs/operator/map.d.ts(1,15): error TS2307: Cannot find module 'rxjs-compat/operator/map'.Solution: install rxjs-compat with the following command: npm install rxjs-compat --save\nStep 2: add code\nNow we will integrate the directive of the helgoland map. Implement the directive of the map by adding the following code to src/app/app.component.html. All fields in the n52-station-map-selector-directive are required to provide options and other information.\n\n  \n\nIs loading: {{loadingStations}}\nOptional the style can be adapted by adding a css style modification to the directive. For example the following code will change the size:  \n\nThis code is implemented in the helgoland-toolbox github repository and can be viewed here.\nImplement the functionality of the n52-station-map-selector-directive by adding the following code to the class AppComponent in src/app/app.component.ts:\npublic providerUrl = 'http://geo.irceline.be/sos/api/v1/';\n\npublic fitBounds: L.LatLngBoundsExpression = [[49.5, 3.27], [51.5, 5.67]];\npublic zoomControlOptions: L.Control.ZoomOptions = { position: 'topleft' };\npublic avoidZoomToSelection = false;\npublic baseMaps: Map = new Map();\npublic overlayMaps: Map = new Map();\npublic layerControlOptions: L.Control.LayersOptions = { position: 'bottomleft' };\npublic cluster = false;\npublic loadingStations: boolean;\npublic stationFilter: ParameterFilter = {\n// phenomenon: '8'\n};\npublic statusIntervals = false;\npublic mapOptions: L.MapOptions = { dragging: true, zoomControl: false };\n\npublic onStationSelected(station: Station) {\n    console.log('Clicked station: ' + station.properties.label);\n}Changeable parameters:\n\nfitBounds - bounding box of the zoom extend adaptle by changing latitude and longitude (currently extend is set to Brüssel)\nzoomControlOptions - position of the zoom control and further options\nlayerControlOptions - position of the layers control and further options\nmapOptions - options concerning the interaction (e.g. to enable zoom or dragging)\n\nThis code is implemented in the helgoland-toolbox github repository and can be viewed here.\nA very important step should not be missedTo use the functionality of the functions in the class AppComponent we need to add the dependencies to use predefined data types or interface (e.g. LayerOptions). Predefined marker icons (the iconURL can be adapted by the path to your own marker image) can also be added, but this is optional to create a map, because otherwise default marker images will be used.\nimport { ParameterFilter, Phenomenon, Station } from '@helgoland/core';\nimport { GeoSearchOptions, LayerOptions } from '@helgoland/map';\nimport * as L from 'leaflet';\n\n// optional, to adapt leaflet markers\nL.Marker.prototype.options.icon = L.icon({\n    iconRetinaUrl: 'assets/img/marker-icon-2x.png',\n    iconUrl: 'assets/img/marker-icon.png',\n    shadowUrl: 'assets/img/marker-shadow.png',\n    iconSize: [25, 41],\n    iconAnchor: [12, 41],\n    popupAnchor: [1, -34],\n    tooltipAnchor: [16, -28],\n    shadowSize: [41, 41]\n});Step 3: add further interaction\nWe have managed to add a helgoland map to our app with markers on it and the possibility to receive click events giving information about which station was clicked. To extend the model by a zoom to extent-button or a list of phenomenons, the following instructions might be helpful.\nAdapt Layers\nTo add layers as for example overlay we can define a function, that adds a tilelayer to the variable `overlayMaps. If this function is executed, a layers control will be visible in the bottomleft corner of the map. The position is adaptable as seen in the list of changeable parameters in the previous step.\nWe will add buttons to the view outside the map and define the script that should be executed in the AppComponent.\n\n  Add Map Layer\n  Remove Map Layer\nFirst, the overlays will be deleted. Two tilelayer, provided by a WMS, will be added to the overlay layers.\n public addOverlayMapLayer() {\n    this.overlayMaps = new Map();\n    this.overlayMaps.set('pm10_24hmean_1x1',\n      {\n        label: 'pm10_24hmean_1x1',\n        visible: true,\n        layer: L.tileLayer.wms('http://geo.irceline.be/rio/wms', {\n          layers: 'pm10_hmean_1x1',\n          transparent: true,\n          format: 'image/png',\n          opacity: 0.7,\n          pane: 'tilePane',\n          zIndex: -9998,\n        })\n      });\n    this.overlayMaps.set('realtime:o3_station_max',\n      {\n        label: 'realtime:o3_station_max',\n        visible: true,\n        layer: L.tileLayer.wms('http://geo.irceline.be/wms', {\n          layers: 'realtime:o3_station_max',\n          transparent: true,\n          format: 'image/png',\n          pane: 'tilePane',\n          zIndex: -9997,\n        })\n      }\n    );\n  }\n\n  public removeOverlayMapLayer() {\n    this.overlayMaps = new Map();\n  }Helgoland Map Control\nWith this Module it is possible to zoom back to the start view position and as well search for streets, cities, countries, etc. .\nAdd HelgolandMapControlModule to the imports of @helgoland/map and also to the imports of @NgModule similar to the way described in earlier steps. Then we can add either the Geosearch Control or the Extent Control or both.\nFor the Geosearch Control we need to add a provider. Therefore add GeoSearch and NominatimGeoSearchService to the imports of @helgoland/map and the following code to the providers array of @NgModule:\nGeosearch and Extended Control\nTo add these controls we need to use GeoSearch as a provider in our src/app/app.module.ts.\n{\n    provide: GeoSearch,\n    useClass: NominatimGeoSearchService\n},Directives to be added in the src/app/app.component.html.\n\nThe code to be added to the class AppComponent, that declares the missing input value for the geosearch-control-directive.\npublic searchOptions: GeoSearchOptions = { countrycodes: [] };Helgoland Selector\nIf you did not install the dependencies @helgoland/selector and @helgoland/depiction yet, than you should install them now as seen in the first step.\nSettings Service Provider\nTo add the Helgoland Selector Module to our app and use the service-filter for the helgoland map, we need to import and extend a service. Therefore we need to import Settings in our ./environements/environment.ts and export the variable settings of type Settings.\nimport { Settings } from '@helgoland/core';\n\nexport let settings: Settings = {};Then we need to create a new folder called settings and a file settings.service.ts in that the service-extension  ExtendedSettingsService will be implemented using the following code:\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Settings, SettingsService } from '@helgoland/core';\n\nimport { settings } from '../../environments/environment';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class ExtendedSettingsService extends SettingsService {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.setSettings(settings);\n    }\n}The ExtendedSettingsService needs to be added to the imports in the src/app/app.module.ts.\nimport { ExtendedSettingsService } from './settings/settings.service';The project tree should look similar to this now:\nsrc\n|___ app\n    |___ settings\n        |___settings.service.ts\n    |___ app.component.html\n    |___ app.component... ~files\n    |___ app.module.ts\n|___ assets\n|___ environments\n    |___ environment.tsService Filter Selector\nFurther, import the additionally installed dependencies to our ng-app by adding the following javascript code to src/app/app.module.ts and adding the imports as well to the imports of @NgModule. Also add the dependency SettingsService to the imports of @helgoland/core:\nimport { HelgolandSelectorModule } from '@helgoland/selector';\nimport { HelgolandDatasetlistModule } from '@helgoland/depiction';We can use the new created ExtendedSettingsService as useClass for our SettingsService provider.\n{\n    provide: SettingsService,\n    useClass: ExtendedSettingsService\n},To add the directive of the filter selector, the following code needs to be added to the src/app/app.component.html.\nAddtionally, to use the select events, the code below can be added to the class AppComponent.\npublic onSelectPhenomenon(phenomenon: Phenomenon) {\n    console.log('Select: ' + phenomenon.label + ' with ID: ' + phenomenon.id);\n    this.stationFilter = {\n        phenomenon: phenomenon.id\n    };\n}Step 4: start working\nNow, that we have added all dependencies and the code to access the functionality of the helgoland map you can start working on your app. If you did not run the app while following this tutorial you should now see the map by starting your app with ng serve and some more interaction possibilities below the map.\nStep 5: check code\nIn the following the main app files can be viewed.

This tutorial can be used as a follow up of Integrate a D3 timeseries component.\nStep 1: Preparation to add new components\n\nadd scss support\n\nadjust in .angular-cli.json the parameter defaults.styleExt from css to scss\n\n\nrestucture of the view to have two other divs beside the diagram\n\nchange app.component.html to ```html\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n```\nrename app.component.css to app.component.scss and adjust it to```scss\n:host {\n    .diagram {\n        height: 500px;\n        flex: 1;\n    }\n    .bottom {\n        display: flex;\n        flex-direction: row;\n        .left,\n        .right {\n            width: 50%;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nadjust the import of the styles in app.component.ts to app.component.scss\n\n\n\nStep 2: Add existing timeseries entry component to app\n\ninstall @helgoland/depiction add HelgolandDatasetlistModule to import\ndo a```bash\nnpm i @helgoland/depiction\n```\nadd HelgolandDatasetlistModule in app.modul.ts to the import list therefor you need to import it:```typescript\nimport { HelgolandDatasetlistModule } from '@helgoland/depiction';\n```\nplease check if you use at least typescript v2.6 or greater, otherwise install it with: ```bash\nnpm i typescript@~2.6\n```\n\n\nadd SettingsService to provider\ncreate an Injectable ExtendedSettingsService which will extend a SettingsService in your project and add the missing imports (SettingsService, Settings of @helgoland/core and Injectable of @angular/core)```typescript\n@Injectable()\nexport class ExtendedSettingsService extends SettingsService {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.setSettings({\n        // TODO add settings here or load it from somewhere else...\n        });\n    }\n}\n```\nadd this ExtendedSettingsService in the list of the providers ```typescript\n{\n    provide: SettingsService,\n    useClass: ExtendedSettingsService\n}\n```\n\n\nadd n52-timeseries-entry to app.component.html (integrate this in the previous created div with the class left)  Common timeseries entries\n  \n      \n  \nadd selectDataset-method to AppComponent class (handles the selection of a dataset triggered inside the timeseries-entry-component)  public selectDataset(selected: boolean, id: string) {\n      if (selected) {\n          this.selectedIds.push(id);\n      } else {\n          this.selectedIds.splice(this.selectedIds.findIndex((entry) => entry === id), 1);\n      }\n  }\nadd isSelected-method to AppComponent class (informs the timeseries-entry-component, if the dataset is selected)\n  public isSelected(id: string) {\n      return this.selectedIds.indexOf(id) > -1;\n  }\nwith a ng serve you should see now the diagram and the listed timeseries entries, by clicking an entry you can highligh it in the diagram\n\n\nStep 3: Extend timeseries entry with new template\n\nadd angular-material in version 5 (see also the here)\ninstall```bash\nnpm i @angular/cdk@^5.0.0 @angular/material@^5.0.0\n```\nadjust app.module.ts with MatCardModule and MatButtonModule in the import list and import them from @angular/material\nadd a style sheet to styles.scss```css\n@import \"~@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css\";\n```\n\n\ncreate new component ExtendedTimeseriesEntryComponent - this will generate a component with a basic template an style sheet. The component is also added to the app.module.ts to the declarations list  ng generate component extended-timeseries\nadjust extended-timeseries.component.html to ```html\n\n    \n        \n            \n            {{phenomenonLabel}} - {{uom}}\n            {{platformLabel}}\n        \n        \n            Highlight\n        \n    \n\n```\nadjust extended-timeseries.component.tsexport class ExtendedTimeseriesComponent extends TimeseriesEntryComponent {\n    public changeColor() {\n        this.datasetOptions.color = this.color.getColor();\n        this.onUpdateOptions.emit(this.datasetOptions);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nStep 4: Add new timeseries entry component to app\n\nadd new component app-extended-timeseries to app.component.html (integrate this in the previous created div with the class right)  Extended timeseries entries\n  \n      \n      \n  \nadd updateOptions-method to AppComponent class (this method is bound with the app-extended-timeseries component and reacts on dataset option changes)  public updateOptions(option: DatasetOptions, id: string) {\n      this.datasetOptionsMultiple.set(id, option);\n  }\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/how-tos/configure-a-map-component.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/how-tos/configure-a-map-component.html","title":"additional-page - Configure a map component","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to configure a map component\nThis tutorial gives a description on how to configure a map component.\nAdd a wms layer\nWith the inputs overlayMaps and baseMaps you can define, which layer should be presented in the map. Here you see an example on how to add a wms layer to the overlayMaps input.\nadd input to the component:\n... [overlayMaps]=\"overlays\" ...add layer to the overlays map:\nimport { tileLayer } from 'leaflet';\n\nthis.overlayMaps.set('some-internal-map-id',\n    {\n        label: 'map-label', // will be shown in layer control\n        visible: true, // is layer by default visible\n        layer: tileLayer.wms(\n            'https://some-wms-url/wms?', // wms-url\n            // wms layer options (see: https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.3.4.html#tilelayer-wms)\n            {\n                maxZoom: 12, // The maximum zoom level to display the layer (inklusive)\n                minZoom: 11, // The minimum zoom level to display the layer (inklusive)\n                bounds: [[51.061, 13.751], [51.047, 13.730]], // show only in this bounds\n                layers: 'layer-id', // comma-seperated list of wms layers to show\n                format: 'image/png', // return format\n                transparent: true // returns images with transparency\n            }\n        )\n    }\n);\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/how-tos/using-basic-auth-services.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/how-tos/using-basic-auth-services.html","title":"additional-page - Using basic auth services","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to using basic auth services\nEnable basic auth support\nJust import BasicAuthModule of the module @helgoland/auth in your application. This will provide an angular service to register additional service urls for the basic auth. It also registers a http interceptor to decide if a basic auth token is needed for the request.\nInform the application that a service url is secured with basic auth\nby settings for all configured dataset-apis\nExtend the configuration in your settings datasetApis with a basicAuth flag, for example in this way:\n\"datasetApis\": [\n  {\n    \"name\": \"BasicAuthSecuredAPI\",\n    \"url\": \"https://url-to/api/v1/\",\n    \"basicAuth\": true\n  }\n]by registering the url by 'hand'\nUse an injected service BasicAuthServiceMaintainer and register the url in this way:\nthis.basicAuthServiceMaintainer.registerService('https://url-to/api/v1/');How to get credentials for a basic auth\nImplement the BasicAuthInformer with the method doBasicAuth. Here you can provide the User a login mask (maybe a modal window), do the auth process. And fulfill the Observable in any case, if authencation was successful or not. See a simple example here:\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { BasicAuthService } from '@helgoland/auth';\nimport { Observable, Observer } from 'rxjs';\nimport { BasicAuthInformer } from '@helgoland/auth';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class BasicAuthInformerImplService implements BasicAuthInformer {\n\n  constructor(\n    private basicAuthSrvc: BasicAuthService\n  ) { }\n\n  public doBasicAuth(url: string): Observable {\n    return new Observable((observer: Observer) => {\n      const username = prompt('Basic Auth username for ' + url);\n      const password = prompt('Basic Auth password for ' + url);\n      this.basicAuthSrvc.auth(username, password, url).subscribe(\n        token => {\n          observer.next(true);\n          observer.complete();\n        },\n        error => {\n          observer.next(false);\n          observer.complete();\n        }\n      );\n    });\n  }\n}\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/how-tos/handle-dataset-options-to-style-the-timeseries.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/how-tos/handle-dataset-options-to-style-the-timeseries.html","title":"additional-page - Handle dataset options to style the timeseries","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHandle styling options for datasets\nStructure of the dataset options\nHere you can see the current structure of the DatasetOption with all it's properties.\nUse a dataset service to manage a set of datasets\nYou can handle a set of datasets and their corresponding dataset options with the abstract class DatasetService. And implementation of this DatasetService provides the following properties, which can be included for example in the D3TimeseriesGraphComponent to display the set of datasets:\n\ndatasetids - An array of datasetIds\ndatasetOptions - A mapped object of the datasetId and a dataset options object\n\nYou can implement this abstract class DatasetService with the following methods:\n\ncreateStyles - This is the default creation of a DatasetOptions, when you add a Dataset without a predefined DatasetOption\nsaveState - Implementation of a mechansim to save this set of DatasetOptions (e.g. in the local storage or to an server)\nloadState - The corresponding loading machanism to the save method.\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/how-tos/add-last-value-map-selector.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/how-tos/add-last-value-map-selector.html","title":"additional-page - Add last value map selector","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Integrate a helgoland map\nThis tutorial gives a short instruction on how to add a last value map into your app.\nadd component to your app\nAdd Component somewhere to HTML\nSample configuration for the component:\npublic lastValueSeriesIDs = [ 'https://www.fluggs.de/sos2/api/v1/__51', 'https://www.fluggs.de/sos2/api/v1/__78', 'https://www.fluggs.de/sos2/api/v1/__95', 'https://www.fluggs.de/sos2/api/v1/__54' ];\npublic lastValuePresentation = LastValuePresentation.Textual;\npublic fitBoundsMarkerOptions: FitBoundsOptions = { padding: [20, 20] };\nlastValueSeriesIDs - list of internal series ids\nlastValuePresentation - type of last value presentation, currently the following options are possible: here\nfitBoundsMarkerOptions - additional adjustments, while zoom to the marker (fitbounds options in leaflet)\n\nconfigure css\nAdd the css to style the label presentation. Play around to find a good solution for your use case:\n.last-value-container {\n  background-color: white;\n  padding: 3px;\n  border: 2px blue solid;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  height: auto !important;\n  width: auto !important;\n  text-align: center;\n}\n\n.last-value-container .last-value-date {\n  display: none;\n  white-space: pre;\n}\n\n.last-value-container:hover {\n  display: inherit;\n  z-index: 999999 !important;\n}\n\n.last-value-container:hover .last-value-date {\n  display: inherit;\n}adjust service\nTo adjust the default LastValueLabelGeneratorService you can write your own service by extend LastValueLabelGenerator\nadd service to module in your app.module\n@NgModule({\n  ...\n  imports: [\n    ...\n    HelgolandMapSelectorModule.forRoot({\n      lastValueLabelGeneratorService: YourCustomizedLastValueLabelGeneratorService\n    }),\n    ...\n  ],\n  ...\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
