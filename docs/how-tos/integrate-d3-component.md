# How to Integrate a D3 timeseries component

In this tutorial a stepwise instruction will be given on how to integrate a D3 timeseries component into an angular app (ng-app).

Starting from the very beginning in setting up the ng-app, angular-cli needs to be installed with npm. If you already have a running project skip Step 1 and start from [Step 2](#step-2:-import-helgoland-dependencies)

## Step 1: create ng-app

Following the instructions of the [angular quickstart guide](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart) a new ng-app will be created with its folder-structure.
Open a terminal and change the working directory to the supposed location, where you want to create your ng-app with an integrated D3 timeseries component. In this tutorial the new ng-app will be named `helgoland-D3`.

||Command|
| ------------- |-------------|
Install angular-cli     |   `npm install -g @angular/cli`
Create ng-app           |   `ng new helgoland-D3`
Change into app-folder  |   `cd helgoland-D3`
Start app               |   `ng serve`

## Step 2: import helgoland dependencies

To start working with the helgoland D3 component a few dependencies are needed: [helgoland-d3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@helgoland/d3) and [helgoland-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@helgoland/core) are necessary to provide the D3 timeseries component, in detail, to visualize the diagram containing the dataset graphs and to get accesss via the dataset API. For these dependencies [leaflet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/leaflet) is required, so this needs to be installed as well. For translations the [ngx-translate-http-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngx-translate/http-loader) is used.

|Install dependencies|
|--------------------|
|`npm i @helgoland/core`|
|`npm i @helgoland/d3`|
|`npm i leaflet`|
|`npm i @ngx-translate/http-loader`|

Import dependencies to your ng-app by adding the following javascript code to `src/app/app.module.ts`:

```javascript
// Add dependencies for helgoland components.
import { HelgolandD3Module } from '@helgoland/d3';
import { DatasetApiInterface, SplittedDataDatasetApiInterface } from '@helgoland/core';

// Add dependencies for translations.
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { TranslateLoader, TranslateModule } from '@ngx-translate/core';
import { TranslateHttpLoader } from '@ngx-translate/http-loader';
```

Another step is to add the dependencies correctly to the `@NgModule`. As imports we will define the `TranslateModule` and the `HelgolandD3Module` and as providers we need to take the `DatasetApiInterface` with the `SplittedDataDatasetApiInterface` as `useClass`. To use the translation functions we will add a function called `HttpLoaderFactory` which is to be exported.
You can compare your `src/app/app.module.ts` file with the following code below:

```javascript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    TranslateModule.forRoot({
      loader: {
        provide: TranslateLoader,
        useFactory: HttpLoaderFactory,
        deps: [HttpClient]
      }
    }),
    HelgolandD3Module
  ],
  providers: [
    {
      provide: DatasetApiInterface,
      useClass: SplittedDataDatasetApiInterface
    }
  ],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }

export function HttpLoaderFactory(http: HttpClient) {
  return new TranslateHttpLoader(http);
}
```

### Suggestions for error handling

- `Cannot find namespace 'GeoJSON'` see below

By manually adapting the configuration in `src/tsconfig.app.js` this issue should be solved. But to let the changes be accepted, the app has to be restarted (by executing `ng serve`). Add to the types-array the type `geojson` which then should look like this:

```json
{
  "extends": "../tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "../out-tsc/app",
    "baseUrl": "./",
    "module": "es2015",
    "types": ["geojson"]
  },
  "exclude": [
    "test.ts",
    "**/*.spec.ts"
  ]
}
```

## Step 3: add code

Now we will integrate the directive of the D3 timeseries component. Implement the directive of the graph by adding the following code to `src/app/app.component.html`. All fields in the `n52-d3-timeseries-graph`-directive are required to provide options, datasets and other information.
Every other code that was generated by the app creation is not necessary to run the D3 timeseries component. This can be deleted or kept for further coding.

```html
<div>
  <n52-d3-timeseries-graph [datasetIds]="datasetIdsMultiple" [selectedDatasetIds]="selectedIds" [datasetOptions]="datasetOptionsMultiple" [timeInterval]="timespan" (onTimespanChanged)="timespanChanged($event)" [graphOptions]="diagramOptionsD3"></n52-d3-timeseries-graph>
</div>
```

- Optional the style can be adapted by adding a css style modification to the directive. For example the following code will change the size:  

```html
<div style="height: 500px; width: 100%;"></div>
```

This code is implemented in the helgoland-toolbox github repository and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/52North/helgoland-toolbox/blob/master/src/demo/app/pages/timeseries-graph/timeseries-graph.component.html).

Implement the functionality of the `n52-d3-timeseries-graph`-directive by adding the following code to `src/app/app.component.ts`:

```javascript
// These variables define the links for accessing the datasets and in which colors they are styled.
public datasetIdsMultiple = ['http://www.fluggs.de/sos2/api/v1/__63', 'http://www.fluggs.de/sos2/api/v1/__72'];
public colors = ['#123456', '#FF0000'];

// The timespan will be set to the last 28 hours which is calculated in milliseconds (milliseconds*1000 = 100000000).
public timespan = new Timespan(new Date().getTime() - 100000000, new Date().getTime());

// These are the plotting options. The boolen of 'togglePanZoom' is set to 'true' to pan the graph.
public diagramOptionsD3: D3PlotOptions = {
    togglePanZoom: true,
    showReferenceValues: false,
    generalizeAllways: true
};

// 'selectedIds' determines the graphs that are visualized with a larger stroke-width. This can be set by clicking on the y-axis.
public selectedIds: string[] = [];
public datasetOptionsMultiple: Map<string, DatasetOptions> = new Map();

constructor() {
    this.datasetIdsMultiple.forEach((entry, i) => {
        this.datasetOptionsMultiple.set(entry, new DatasetOptions(entry, this.colors[i]));
    });
}

// This function changes the timespan of the graph which is needed for panning (and zooming).
public timespanChanged(timespan: Timespan) {
    this.timespan = timespan;
}
```
This code is implemented in the helgoland-toolbox github repository and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/52North/helgoland-toolbox/blob/master/src/demo/app/pages/timeseries-graph/timeseries-graph.component.ts).

**A very important step should not be missed**  
To use the functionality of the functions in the `src/app/app.component.ts` we need to add the dependencies to use for example `Timespan` and `D3PlotOptions`. This is done by using the following imports:

```javascript
import { DatasetOptions, Timespan } from '@helgoland/core';
import { D3PlotOptions } from '@helgoland/d3';
```

## Step 4: start working

Now, that we have added all dependencies and the code to access the functionality of the D3 timeseries component you can start working on your app. If you did not run the app while following this tutorial you should now see the timeseries graph by starting your app with `ng serve`.
